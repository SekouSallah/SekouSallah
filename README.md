I'm a Software Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Kube Astronaut, with a strong focus on Open Source, Cloud-Native architectures, and platform engineering.

My main programming languages and frameworks include **Java**, **Quarkus**, **Spring Boot**, **Go**, and **Node.js**.

I design, build, and operate scalable, resilient, and observable systems running in modern cloud environments. My daily work revolves around automation, developer experience, and operational excellence.

I strongly believe in **open standards**, **community-driven innovation**, and learning by contributing.

I work extensively with cloud-native technologies and practices, including:

* **Kubernetes** (workloads, networking, security, operators)
* **Terraform**, **Ansible**, **Puppet**, **Pulumi**
* **Red Hat OpenShift** (enterprise Kubernetes, security, operators, GitOps)
* **Cloud-Native patterns** (microservices, event-driven, GitOps)
* **Docker**, **Helm**, **Kustomize**
* **CI/CD** with Jenkins GitHub Actions, ArgoCD
* **Observability** (metrics, logs, tracing)
